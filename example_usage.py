SUMMARY: Enhanced User Profile Management
TYPE: Feature
STATUS: In Development
PRIORITY: High

DESCRIPTION:
As a user, I want to be able to manage my profile information more effectively so that I can keep my data up-to-date and personalized.

- Personal information editing with validation
- Privacy settings and visibility controls
- Account activity monitoring
- Profile completion progress tracking

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Users can upload and crop profile pictures
- All personal information fields are editable with proper validation
- Users can control who sees their profile information
- Activity log shows recent profile changes
- Progress indicator shows profile completion percentage
